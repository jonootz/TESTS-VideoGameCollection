                <p><span style="background-color: #8b008b; color: #ff6347;">Hyrule Warriors</span> mixes the hack-and-slash gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series of video games with the settings and characters from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. Amongst many other characters, the player controls an original iteration of Link in melee combat to take on large numbers of enemies from the Legend of Zelda series. While there is a much stronger emphasis on combat than other games in the Legend of Zelda series, the player may use common weapons from prior games in the series, such as a sword, bombs, and Link's signature spin attack. Enemy targeting also returns, in combination with elements from the Dynasty Warriors combat system. Obtaining items through discovering and opening chests is retained as well.</p>
                <p>The game has a context-based combat system. Depending on the character selected, the abilities of weapons equipped will change. Role-playing elements such as weapon and character leveling will also appear. Defeating enemies will give players weapons bags, which will equip a random weapon for the character. "Sealed weapons" may also be found in treasure boxes, which increase the types of weapons randomly generated for the player in the field. The game supports an asymmetric local two-player mode with one player using the Wii U GamePad and another using a monitor. The game is also compatible with Amiibo figures, with figures based on The Legend of Zelda series unlocking additional content such as new weapons.</p>
                <p>Besides combat, Hyrule Warriors will offer an additional quest to collect 100 Gold Skulltulas, tokens that appear in specific levels after defeating enough enemies, which will unlock illustration pieces of the several characters in the game and contribute to upgrading the in-game apothecary.</p>

            <p MadCap:targetName="Plot">The game is set in Hyrule, outside of the official Zelda timeline.[13] Long ago, Ganondorf was defeated and his soul splintered into four fragments. Three of them were sealed in different moments in time, while the fourth was trapped by the Master Sword. But Ganondorf plots his resurrection through Cia, a sorceress who protects the balance of the Triforce while maintaining neutrality. Cia becomes fascinated with the spirit of the hero of legend, with her amorous feelings for the hero providing Ganondorf an opportunity to purge her inner light. As a result, Cia becomes consumed in her desires, opening the Gate of Souls, a portal to different time-space realities of Hyrule, to amass an army of monsters. Seeking to unite the Triforce and conquer Hyrule, she uses her subordinates Wizzro and Volga to wage war against Princess Zelda and the Hyrulian army.</p>
            <p>As Cia's forces attack Hyrule Castle, Link, a Hyrulian soldier-in-training, rushes out to aid the other troops, discovering he possesses the Triforce of Courage. However, the castle is taken and Princess Zelda is unaccounted for in the aftermath, so Hyrulian general Impa asks Link to aid her in finding the princess. Weeks later, while still searching, Link and Impa meet Sheik, a Sheikah warrior who claims to know Zelda's whereabouts, and Lana, a white sorceress from the same clan as Cia. The group heads to the Valley of Seers hoping to close the Gate of Souls, but Cia traps Link and Sheik, who is revealed as the bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom. Cia steals both Triforce pieces, combining them with her own Triforce of Power, and uses the completed Triforce to open portals in time and space to the resting places of Ganondorf's spirit fragments.</p>
            <p>To restore Hyrule to normal, Link, Impa, and Lana each lead their own campaign to drive out Cia's armies and close the Gates of Souls in each era. Along the way, they are aided by each time period's native heroes, including Darunia and Princess Ruto from Ocarina of Time, Agitha and Midna from Twilight Princess, and Fi from Skyward Sword. During this time, Sheik reveals herself to be Princess Zelda in disguise, and Lana explains that she and Cia were once the same person, with Lana embodying the light Ganondorf purged from Cia's heart. Meanwhile, three of Ganondorf's spirit fragments are released, allowing for his body to be resurrected. No longer needing Cia, he attempts to take the Triforce, but Cia sends Link and Zelda's pieces back to their owners and uses her own piece to lock Ganondorf away.</p>
            <p>After retrieving the Master Sword, Link prepares to confront Cia, the sword's power strengthened by his bonds of friendship. He defeats her and she fades away, with Lana inheriting her piece of the Triforce. Using the completed Triforce's power, the time-displaced heroes are sent back to their own periods and Hyrule is restored to normal, with Lana once again closing the Gate of Souls. However, due to the Master Sword's removal, the last of Ganondorf's spirit fragments is released, and Ganondorf is fully resurrected, summoning Ghirahim and Zant from across time and space. With their combined efforts, Ganondorf manages to retake all three Triforce pieces from their bearers, using it to strengthen his army and take over Hyrule Castle. However, Lana summons the heroes from Hyrule's history, and the combined group of heroes defeat Ghirahim and Zant before venturing towards Ganon's Tower. Link manages to defeat Ganondorf, but he uses the Triforce to transform himself into Beast Ganon. With the help of Zelda's light arrows, Link defeats Ganon, and the heroes use the Triforce to seal him away once more. The heroes of the past are returned, Lana resumes watching over the Triforce in Cia's place, and Link and Zelda return the Master Sword to its pedestal to prevent Ganondorf's escape.</p>
